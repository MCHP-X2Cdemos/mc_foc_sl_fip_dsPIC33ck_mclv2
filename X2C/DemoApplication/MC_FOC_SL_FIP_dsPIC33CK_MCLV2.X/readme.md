# MC_FOC_SL_FIP_dsPIC33CK_MCLV2_MCC

TBD

## Getting Started

The project and the code is generated by MPLAB X MCC and X2C (Scilab model).
Use MPLAB X to open the project.
Use MCC plugin to configure the peripherals.
Use Scilab and X2C to modify the model and generate code.
Use X2C communicator or X2C Scope plugin to monitor signals during runtime.

### Prerequisites

MPLAB X IDE, MCC, XC compiler, Scilab/XCOS, X2C knowledge.

### Software
* [MPLAB X 5.20](https://www.microchip.com/mplab/mplab-x-ide)
* [XC Compilers](https://www.microchip.com/mplab/compilers)
* [Scilab v5.2.2](https://www.scilab.org/download/5.5.2) (Scilab 6.x is not supported yet)
* [X2C v6](https://www.sim2tronic.com/downloads/)

Model sample rate: 1.0E-4

### Built With

* [XC16](https://www.microchip.com/mplab/compilers) - Microchip C compiler for 16bit micros
